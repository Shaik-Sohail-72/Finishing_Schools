/*
There is a network of servers, given in the form of a directed graph and data is constantly being transfered among these servers. You can send the data from a given source server 's' to a destination server 't'. The data has to be tranfered along the disjoint paths. Find the maximum number of disjoint paths through which the data can be transfered.
 
Note:Two paths are said to be disjoint paths, if they donâ€™t share any edge.

 Example:
 input =8
0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 7

output = 2
